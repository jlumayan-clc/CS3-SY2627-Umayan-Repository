Scenario

The PSHS school canteen is small and often gets crowded during lunch break. Students line up to buy food, but the process is slow because:

- Some students take too long to decide what to order.
- The cashier has to manually calculate totals and give change.
- There is no system to track which food items are running out.
Your group’s task is to decompose this problem into smaller, manageable parts that could be solved with computational thinking (CT) Skills.

Step 1: Identify the Big Problem

Main Problem: The canteen has slow service while the amount of customers waiting in line is too much.

Step 2: Identify three to four Sub-Problems
Please list possible sub-problems:

1. Slow decision-making among customers

2. Manual cash calculations by the servers

3. Untracked food inventory

Step 3: Define Computational Thinking Approaches
For each sub-problem, apply CT skills:

| Sub-Problem          | CT Skill            | Example Solution                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Slow decision-making | Abstraction         | Display a simple menu with only the pictures, names, and prices of meals available. |
| Manual calculation   | Algorithm           | Make a system that automatically gets the total price of the customer's             |
|                      |                     | order and calculate the exact change when payment is given.                         |
| Untracked inventory  | Pattern Recognition | Analyze data to predict high-demand items and use a stock counter to notify servers |
|                      |                     | when a certain item is low on stock.                                                |

Step 4: Draw a flowchart or write a pseudocode for the identified sub-problem

Sub-problem 2 pseudocode:

(this code only works if there is one item [itemname] on the menu)
DECLARE itemname : STRING
DECLARE order : STRING
DECLARE menuitem : STRING
DECLARE itemprice : INTEGER
DECLARE total : INTEGER

itemname = <item>
itemprice = <price>

total = 0
order = yes

WHILE order = yes
  OUTPUT "Enter the name of the item: "
  INPUT menuitem
  IF menuitem = itemname THEN
    total = total + itemprice
    OUTPUT "Successfully added ", menuitem, " to your order!"
  ELSE
    OUTPUT "Sorry, item not recognized."
  ENDIF
  OUTPUT "Add an item to your order? (yes/no): "
  INPUT order
ENDWHILE

OUTPUT "Your total is ₱", total
