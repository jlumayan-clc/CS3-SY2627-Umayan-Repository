Questions with Checklists

1. Efficiency
Which algorithm is faster when the list of numbers is very large? Why?

5. Security
Imagine the input list comes from a user. What should the algorithm check to avoid errors or misuse?

The algorithm should check if the list contains valid inputs so it doesn't crash.
