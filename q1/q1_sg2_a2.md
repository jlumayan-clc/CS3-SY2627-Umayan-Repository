Questions with Checklists

1. Efficiency
Which algorithm is faster when the list of numbers is very large? Why?

Algorithm 1 is significantly faster when dealing with lists that contain large numbers because it only uses one loop and has fewer lines of code as compared to algorithm 2.

2. Readability

Which algorithm is easier to understand at first glance? What makes it clearer?

Algorithm 1 does not require much thinking to understand the code. It is much shorter and the logic used is simple.
